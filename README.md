### Ruby Challege 2

<p> Prompt: </p>

>Write a program which calculates the value of an investment given the initial amount PV, the annual interest rate i, and the number of years to invest n. Use the following formula to calculate the future value: <br>
![FV = PV(i + 1) ** n](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0cba9bb4d1a4e42b812e200dff3f0d056b31f9727d2cfe9050b4b2268d69c0d4/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f686f72697a6f6e2d70726f64756374696f6e2f696d616765732f65306361383761383263353931613065303631303739323936333735316664352e706e67)

> The output of the program should look as follows:

> What is the amount being invested: 1000 <br>
> What is the annual interest rate (percentage): 10 <br>
> How many years will it accrue interest: 25 <br>

> The final value will be $10834.71 after 25 years.
